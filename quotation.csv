Dear Mr. Uvarov,
 
Please note shipment has been collected.
 
Truck will depart on the 17/02 with arrival in Athens on the 20/02.
 
because this is not a normal export shipment, spares are  inside a Bonded Warehouse area, so trucking company have to wait till end of week to load other export orders because transit orders have to be loaded as a last shipment of truck.
 
 
Thank you and Best Regards,

Hi Betul,

I assume that this shipment is still at the airline’s warehouse at the airport, right?

The client just asked me to check and advise storage cost for keeping it there for 2 months until vessel calls Turkey.

Please advise.

Thank you!

Dear Avgie,

Kindly find here the POD document attached of our delivery.
 
Our service is scheduled in March since your port call in Rodman would be only in March, as the pulley is expected to be there around that time. 
Find the email in which we based our attendance.
 
Let me know should you need anything else and once you receive the spares we send.

Dear Amit,
 
Thanks for this. 
 
I would suggest to deliver them for end of February, I see that port stay in Nhava Sheva its quite short, and due to customs formalities in India could lead in spares delays. 
 
Could you please send me port calls around the mentioned time? I will check in them availability for the service.
 
Thanks a lot
